# zordview
Visualize binary file as Z-order curve

Power of 2 boundaries are common in binary file formats. Human visual perception of locality is 2 dimensional. Increasing apparent locality of nearby elements and applying naturally likely boundary locations between localities may be visually useful. To this end, Z-order curve.

This demo is made by running ./zordview zordview demo-zord.png. It is the content of the executable file itself, visualized. As opposed to the demo-lin.png which is a linear representation.
